    <h1><u>CUSTOMER INSIGHTS</u></h1>

        <p>As a Blogger user, then a MT user, then a B2 user, and now a WP user - I must say I'm impressed. I wasn't quite sure what to expect upon switching over, but given the death of b2, I decided to take the leap and try its official successor. Installation/upgrading was relatively easy, and I've already found so much more to like over b2:</p>
        <ul>
      <li>comments/pingbacks/trackbacks are all rolled into one commenting feature. It makes things so much clearer when people want to interact with what you've written.</li>
      <li>faster. WordPress handles just about everything faster than b2. And I mean everything.</li>
      <li>list management. God bless Blogrolling, but I've been waiting for someone to integrate it into a blogging software.</li>
      <li>continual building. Please keep up the development of this, its what makes it so much fun to use, always adding in features and styling all the available settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Great job, guys, keep up the great work!</p>

        <p>I have been a loyal MovableType user for a couple of years now. I went to upgrade perl on my system (apparently 5.8.2 and MT don't like each other) and MT puked on me. I am a UNIX sysadmin by trade, so I am not ignorant of the ins and outs of upgrading software on a webserver. In spite of performing every test, upgrade, and change I could, including mod_perl and all of the modules required by MT, in the end, MT was still broken.</p>

    <p>When I first installed MT, I had been looking for a php based weblog engine, but could not find one I liked as much as MT. Having now discovered WordPress, I am a happy man, and will not be looking back.</p>

    <p>I managed to write a quick and dirty php script to migrate my existing MT entries in MySQL to WordPress, which was a paltry 147 entries. However, using php’s ereg_replace and preg_replace functions, I was able to translate all of my MTMacros during the transfer. It was much simpler than any of the alternatives (manual mysqldump and edit — yuck!) and it was clean. I will be able to modify the script to migrate the other 2 weblogs I host (at time of this writing, I've already done one!).<p>

    <p>From my just under 24 hours of experience with WordPress, I’m a happy man. This is fantastic code, and it’s only just getting on its feet! The updates that are forthcoming promise to make this one of the premiere weblog engines on the web today. Good work! I eagerly await your future versions!</p>

    <p>I had been an avid b2 user for the last 6 months or so, but then decided to take advantage of WordPress’s features, commitment to extra development and stable codebase. So far, so good.</p>

    <p>WP offers an excellent, easy-to-use upgrade path from b2, outputs XHTML-compliant frontend code, and as of 0.71 offers some extraordinarily useful features such as private entries, integrated link manager and upgraded speed that you'd expect to see in a *cough*paid*cough* product. There is also an active community of users to assist with any problems, and above all it is easy to use, with minimal fuss.</p>

    <p>With all of WP’s slated changes (Smarty templates, multimedia extensions (Gallery, anyone? :)), even support for importing MovableType posts!) WP has a bright future. Another happy user here — thanks Mike, Matt and the other developers. Keep up the great work.</p>

    <p>I was using b2, the development of which seemed to have somewhat stagnated, and I was searching for a way to put into it a few of the features floating around that other blog solutions had. That's how I found WordPress. What better solution than to use this elegant system as a replacement/upgrade for b2.</p>

    <p>Installation, usability and extensibility all packaged in a poetic package of code.</p>

    <p>I'm not looking back :)</p>

    <p>Two antlers, WAY UP! Being one of the largest denizens of the coniferous forests of northeastern British Columbia, I have very particular needs. After my initial Blogger experience (can I say that word here?) I was left wanting more, but alas, I suffered from newbie shock when I moved on to other tools. Grey Matter beckoned, and I got it installed, but it was simply not for me. One evening, after a long day of tromping through the underbrush, I was googling for a new blogging tool, and tripped and fell over something called "WordPress." Well, I downloaded it, scoffed at the claim of a five-minute install, and tried it out. Five minutes or so later, I was typing my first test post...then I saw that version 0.72 had just been released. I quickly upgraded, and haven't looked back since. Ten out of ten moose recommend WordPress as THE publishing suite of the 21st Century.</p>

    <p>I had used b2 for over a year and was surprised when I saw it was not being developed further. When Word Press came along, I installed, imported my old b2 entries and have been blogging happily since then.</p>

    <p>Between easy to understand installment and configuration, using MySQL, being FREE and having an excellent support forum, you just can't beat Word Press for your content management system!</p>

    <p>Word Press is still in the infancy stage but already surpasses other CMS by a lot. I can't wait to see what's in the next release!</p>

    <p>Thank you Mike, Matt and the other folks working on this great blogging tool. Keep up the excellent work, people are grateful and they do sit up and take notice!</p>

    <p>WordPress works great and is easy to use and setup on Mac OS X! Overall a great bit software if you are looking to setup and maintain your own blog.</p>

    <p>I’ve tried a few other bloggers, and I thought that Greymatter was as good as it got. Then I found WordPress. Easy to install, easy to set up, easy to use, and more features than I will ever need. Just fantastic! I'm ashamed how little of it's capability I'm using!</p>

    <p>Thanks to the everyone involved, and keep up the great work guys!</p>
